                <p class="center">
                    Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado,
                    flood, hurricane or blizzard. Families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from
                    being prepared in the event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the
                    immediate
                    few days after the disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.Disaster victims can survive
                    for
                    several days without food, but only for a short time without water.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Medical</h2>
                <p class="center">Disaster has both acute and chronic effects on the physical
                    and mental health of the affected population. In the aftermath of disaster injuries,
                    spread of communicable diseases and worsening of non-communicable diseases is
                    reported in several studies.Medical records were created and kept for all patients
                    seen at the camps. Patients who presented to camps were registered with personal
                    information regarding name,age etc.Running a medical relief camp after a flood disaster
                    requires a high level of expertise and resources.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Shelter</h2>
                <p class="center">During flood disaster, people in affected areas seek a safe place to stay.
                    Most people evacuate to shelter, which is a public safe place usually organized and provided
                    by government. Not only provides a place for evacuees, but shelter also works as a distributer
                    to provide necessary supplies for people staying in their houses in surrounding effected area.
                    Water from streams, lakes and local water systems can become contaminated; therefore, it is best
                    to store a supply of water in the shelter area.
